'''
Extracts sim and boot records from compressed game files downloaded from
a tournament archive. Call logIter(url, dir) where url is the archive
descriptor (a csv file) and
dir is the directory that is to contain the (compressed) game logs.
This returns an iterator over directory names within the target directory.
Initially this directory must exist.

    Returns a generator of log dirs extracted from a directory
    of compressed game logs, downloading them first if necessary.
    Each dir will contain the state log, trace log, and boot.xml file.
    To use this, you need a file games.txt in the data dir that contains
    the filenames of the compressed log files.
